# Fix bug

This skill carries no rules of its own. The repository files are the source of truth.

1. Read `docs/process/agent-prompt.md` and follow its core prompt.
2. Read `docs/process/prompts/05-fix-bug.md` and follow it as the procedure for this job.
3. Fix one bug only: the given `bug/` file, or an observation that creates one.

Stop at human gates (ADR accept). After spec is law: tests of the slice must fail on current code, then the fix. Commit each completed step (spec, then green tests+code). If spec was not edited, say `spec unchanged`. Do not mix uncommitted spec and code. Do not merge or push to the default branch.
